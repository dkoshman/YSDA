Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse.  The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.  \\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion.  Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly.\n",

This \"greatest hits\" compilation has only 9 songs from a group that has been putting out top-shelf albums for about 15 years. How can that possibly add up? Don't get me wrong, there isn't a bad song on this cd, but there is so much missing. What would've really worked well for the fans would have been a 2-disc package with the first having songs from cypress hill, black sunday, and temples of boom. The second could pick from IV, skull and bones, stoned raiders, and till death do us part. Also throw some live joints on there (\"aint going out like that\", \"can't get the best of me\") from the Fillmore show, and that would be more on the level with showing what the Hill is all about.\n",

All three were leading exponents of the flamenco form during that era, but of the three I actually enjoyed Bernabe de Moron's music the most.I was devastated when my original LP recording was damaged and I tried for years to find a replacement, without success.

    "**Плюсы:**\n",
    "- Похожие по контексту слова оказываются похожди в пространстве эмбеддингов\n",

    "**Минусы:**\n",
    "- Плохо справляется со словами вне словаря. К примеру, если в текстах корпуса встречались достаточно часто слова 'tensor' и 'flow', но не встречался 'tensorflow', то модель пометит последний как просто '\\<unk\\>'\n",
    "- Никак не переиспользует параметры для слов с общими корнями (к пр. 'eat', 'eats', 'eaten', 'eater', 'eating') - для модели это просто разные слова и каждое из них учится отдельно из контекста, тогда как слова сильно завязаны по смыслу."
